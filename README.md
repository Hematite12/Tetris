Tetris clone in Processing.

These files run a Tetris app within Processing. Main.py interfaces with functions in Processing to animate the game and take inputs from the player. Board.py contains the logic of the game, including generating the "ghost" image of where the piece will end up if the player drops it and handling collisions with walls or other pieces in the Tetris way. Constants.py has relevant constant values for the game. Pieces are considered to have a center they rotate around.
